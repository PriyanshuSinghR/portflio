      <p>
        Now let's see where I should start from.... Ok, I start from my home,
        when I said to my mother that I want to go solo trip then my mother was
        so care about, then they didn't allow me but when my mother at good
        mood, I go and ask my mother, please allow me, and give some reason, so
        that my mother allow me even it is my first time I dont know about it
        that much. I mean, they know I study many places and live there alone,
        but those all places are in my state, but that time I ask for going
        different state. So, I think it's bother her that how people of that
        state, anyway they finally allow me and I book my ticket after 1 day and
        I take off to my city at night and next morning at last I am at shimla.
      </p>

      <h2>Day 1st</h2>
      <p>
        Now the point is this where should I have to go like I read the blog and
        I already know whereI have to go, but point is that whole place is new
        for me and I don't even know where I have to take bus for Narkanda and I
        am alone I scare to ask for some one because in our life we are full
        fill our need with internet but we all are really forgot about how to
        ask help or talk to other because people really are so on with internet
        but in mountain there is no google map so that's not the solution for my
        question, so same happen to me and I take long breath and ask a person
        and I don't know I felt so empty that time and happy, that is my very
        loveful experience. Then I take bus, its take 3 hours and then I am at
        Narkanda and then after that I dont know. I like to ask people, and I
        really love those and I ask people even small-small things like where is
        a good place to eat. Then I asked some people what was a good place to
        visit, and they said. Hatu peak, it is 10 km small track and one thing I
        really love adventurous thing so I decided to walk and start walking
        with that huge bag on my back but then I went on peak then I find people
        come with car, but I think what I experience with walk. its different
        and I then know how much long 10kmthan the flat area. In peak I find so
        guys they are also come but only visite for narkanda because office work
        and in the peak there is snow. I play with snow and then come back to
        peak, and when I come down to peak then there are also people, so my
        time passes with talking to those people and even asking about good
        place to stay but I am on a tight budget, so I have to take somewhere to
        stay with very low price that old women ask me about my next destnation
        then I said its and jori then she said if you want budget so stay in
        jouri is so good and afordable. Then at same day its 4pm I take off from
        narkanda and then I am at joiri at 9pm and one thing in mountain night
        its dark very fast like at 5pm its like night and there is time 9pm
        andthere is no person whom I ask help and I find one person but I scared
        because I am all alone and no body in that area that time its scilent
        road but that time I have no choice and I ask him he suggest me temple
        of bheem kali and I really there is stay so less like if you stay in
        dormant its cost Rs.70 and Rs.300 of room. And I take dormant because I
        am only one who stay that dormant.
      </p>

      <h2>Day 2nd</h2>
      <p>
        The next morning is on Jori and so many people are visiting that place
        because it is a temple and thing when I wake up so I see I don't have my
        bag because I forgot it last night at the bus stand and nobody believe
        that when I go again that bus stand then my bag is still there where I
        left and I see my whole item all are there are nobody take so that what
        I see there is how safe that place is because if that happens in my city
        so I will never see my bag again. And when I travel I have one habit I
        leave my place in the early morning and then come back in the evening
        and that is how I ask for a room giving the same reason that I will not
        live much in your place I just want a room at night so they discount it
        or you say I am good at bargaining. And then then I walk to the mountain
        and I don't know where I go I just walk and find a new place and then I
        visit some village and play with the child and then come back and also
        see all the visited places. And then at night, I go for walk with the
        temple canteen worker, and he give me information about Buddhism all
        rules and regulation because he was live with the monk and learn at the
        age of 5 so he know so many things. So, I ask so many things because I
        have so many questions about Buddhism and I am very curious about that.
        Because they are a very spiritual person so they tell me everything and
        give all answers. And then I eat and sleep.
      </p>

      <h2>Day 3rd</h2>
      <p>
        The next day I woke up at 4 am and take the bus for chitkul and for that
        first I have to take off that johri village So I take the bus to the
        highway(I don't know what to say) and that day is Sunday and I wait for
        the bus but I can't find any bus for chitkul and then I ask for local
        then he tells me that Sunday there is no bus for chitkul then I have to
        change my plane and that same time I decided that for my next
        destination and that the one thing I learn about in mountain there is no
        plane apply for anything like anything happen anytime and also we can't
        predict future like what is next place or how weather good or bad but
        yes we have to make some plan but we also ready for everything because
        nothing is at the plan in the mountain. That time I decided I have to
        take the bus to Nako I take the bus at 6 pm and the driver take me to
        Nako at 9 pm and it's so much snowfall and it was so much because it is
        very high and I think no visitors there except me and it also I didn't
        decide but now the bus is only one in that route so I have only one
        option that stays today here and waits for next day and I also know the
        date because that day is my birthday and one thing like those places
        there is no network and it so much high and local people tell me that
        when down recongpeo there is rain so in upside Nako there is heavy
        snowfall and then I think what I have to do so I go to that mountain I
        don't know the name but there is only one moutain that above that
        mountain so I take my bag and just start track and when I go so above
        then I met 4 young women they are going to some temple, they ask me can
        you come with us but that time I dont have time she said its take 3 days
        to go and visite temple and come back. But then I don't have time and
        also I think that something I have to leave for next time so I have
        reason to come again and then I come back and eat and then I sleep where
        those dhaba people sleep I enjoy with those people I dont have place to
        stay so I stay those grass house and I even take on grass on me like a
        blanket but Its also some diffrent experiences what I get.
      </p>
      <h2>Day 4th</h2>
      <p>
        The next day I woke up at 5 am because tomorrow I have only one choice
        is to take the bus and timing I already know I was well prepared to get
        back to the same route and go to recongpeo. The place is Kinnaur and the
        district of Kinnaur is Recongpeo(people only call peo so don't be
        confused). There is one place in Kinnaur is Kalpa which is very famous
        for apples and it's called Kinnauri Apple which is a black apple when I
        walk I just eat apples because there are so many trees or you say only
        trees of apples. Kalpa is a place there is one small road it's like very
        beautiful road it's like the whole road is covered with apple trees and
        at that time apple blossom time so flow is growing up and just so many
        flowers are took off to the trees and its look like soo beautiful(called
        Romantic road). And when we move forward there is a place called Suicide
        Point and then move forward and there is a village its name I don't know
        then I came back and it's night and then I sleep.
      </p>

      <h2>Day 5th</h2>
      <p>
        The next day I woke up at 4 am and take the bus to chitkul and that the
        place is so beautiful when I first look, it was so beautiful. But there
        is the road is so bad and the driver is even worse he drives like a
        crazy person like if I have to give an excuse to not go there so that is
        the only excuse I don't go because the bus is like hell. Anyway, that
        place is so cold and there is the river which is so a beautiful place
        and anyone loves that view. That chitkul is also called the Last Village
        of India. And there is a very famous dhabha is called Hindustan Ka Akhri
        Dhabha. But there is a problem with the water because it blocks because
        of cold so all pipeline is covered with snow and block the water. At
        last I love that place and I stay here 2 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the 7th day morning, I left chitkul and went back to Shimla, it took
        a whole day(because I have to change so many buses), and in the evening
        6 pm, I am to Shimla then I am back in Delhi in Next day.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        There is something that I want to highlight or what I learned.
        <li>
          Don't be too dependent on Internet, because some time internet also
          does not work. So try to habit of asking help to people because they
          also like to help.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't be too dependent on your plan because they fail on the mountain.
          So, make a plan but also be ready for when it fails.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sometimes Risk is also important to viewing something different that
          you can't see in your comfort zone.
        </li>
