      <p>
        Let's start with a start when I come to college in 1st semester of 2019,
        At that time I didn't know about React but I know about Web development
        thanks to my brother. But I truly say that time I take it easy and don't
        give my time to web development. But when I have time or I am saying
        something productive so I did web development basics like HTML, CSS, and
        JS. And as usual, everyone is watching the lecture so I also did that
        thing and also learn with freecodecamp(but I don't like it that much at
        that time I think because I am a beginner but now I think it's the best
        source to start with web development). I was not saying I am not
        learning anything but yes I can do even a good option but I think that
        time is a good choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, let's move on so that semester is over in 2020 then when I go
        home my brother also switched their job from AI to web development then
        he tell me about ReactJS because I saw my brother prepare for that thing
        for 6 months. So then I also start to see React but if I say truly I
        don't understand and the more I learn so more I am doubtful about React
        so I am very frustrated and my brother doesn't tell me about anything I
        just see him so I try to learn that because somehow I know that what he
        doing is best. But I didn't get my answer and I truly say how much I
        surf the internet to find my answer I get more questions and I am more
        confused. Then my brother tells me about some MERN courses at udemy. The
        point is this after simple development (HTML, CSS, js) when React,
        Redux, Node comes I just watched it I don't learn that much. So, I
        always try to find where I learn from, and then I met my senior on
        social media I see him he talk about React so I think he might help me
        out so, I dm him then he tell me about some courses of progat, and I say
        its good but I am not happy with that much because I complete the whole
        thing I mean every course of web developer like React, Node, even Ruby &
        Rails in one month. Then after that, I said to him I complete it but I
        want more so then he tell me about someone who change my life. He tells
        me about Tanay Bhaiya and at that time he recently teaches about the
        zero-level course and after that time I follow him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my 3rd semester, my result is bad in 2021 I more focus on my
        academics but I still learn about React, now I am a bit slow but I
        always searching for my answer because that time I want more like what
        Tanay bhaiya teach me. So mostly that year is a waste on academics,
        college projects, and some stuck personal projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in 2022 my one big project is stuck in a year so it's solved so, I
        am motivated but there is a big motivation in my brother because he is
        making a good amount of money with React which I never think I ever go
        there and that fast growth. So that time I am more motivated so this
        year I make so many big projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But still, I will not stop, my journey is starting now and I want to go
        beyond that present of my version. Keep moving always.....
